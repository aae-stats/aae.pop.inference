`aae.pop.inference` supports inference on population dynamics models
implemented in `aae.pop`. These models are relatively complex, making
standard inference methods (e.g.Â maximum likelihood, MCMC) challenging,
especially as the models become realistically complex (many population
classes, temporal variability). `aae.pop.inference` uses a sequential
approximate Bayesian computation approach to support fast inference on
these complex models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of aae.pop.inference from
[GitHub](https://github.com/aae-stats/aae.pop.inference) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("aae-stats/aae.pop.inference")
```

## Example: estimating carrying capacity and density dependence

This example uses data simulated from a model as a target to estimate
the parameters of this model. This relatively simple example (estimating
parameters of a known model) illustrates how to perform inference on
these models but also highlights a case in which the target parameters
are highly correlated.

# define a basic population model with aae.pop
nclass <- 5
popmat <- matrix(0, ncol = nclass, nrow = nclass)
popmat[transition(popmat)] <- c(0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8)
popmat[reproduction(popmat)] <- c(0, 1, 4, 10)
dd <- density_dependence(
  funs = ricker(100, exclude = 1),
  masks = reproduction(popmat)
)
pop_fn <- dynamics(matrix = popmat, dd)

# simulate some data from this model to use as a target data set
obs <- simulate(
  pop_fn,
  nsim = 1000,
  args = list(density_dependence = list(theta = 0.4))
)

# define wrapper so we can simulate from the model based on
#   the inference parameters alone
popsim_fn <- function(par) {

  tmp <- update(
    pop_fn,
    density_dependence(
      funs = ricker(par[1], exclude = 1),
      masks = reproduction(popmat)
    )
  )

  sim <- simulate(tmp, nsim = 100, args = list(density_dependence = list(theta = par[2])))

  stat_abundance_trend(sim)

}

# calculate the target from the simulated data set
target <- stat_abundance_trend(obs)

# estimate parameters by comparing the simulation model to
#   the simulated data set with uniform priors on 
#   carrying capacity (U[50, 500]) and the theta parameter
#   of the Ricker density dependence (U[0.01, 1])
abc_est <- inference(
  model = popsim_fn,
  prior = list(
    c("unif", 50, 500),
    c("unif", 0.01, 1)
  ),
  target = target,
  nb_simul = 100,
  progress_bar = FALSE
)
```

Plotting the estimated posteriors for the two parameters suggests
relatively broad distributions with high uncertainty. However, a plot of
these two parameters against one another highlights their close
relationship, with a near perfect linear correlation between the two.
